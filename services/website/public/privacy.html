      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <p>
        Popouts ("Popouts", "we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy applies to the Popouts Chrome Extension, our website at www.popouts.app, and related services.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Popouts collects only the minimum information necessary to provide its functionality.
      </p>

      <h3>A. Information you provide</h3>
      <p>
        When you use Popouts, you may provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meeting notes and text content</li>
        <li>License key (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Email address (if you use the "Request Access" or website contact forms)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Meeting notes and related meeting information are stored locally in your browser and may also be securely transmitted to and stored on Popouts servers to provide features such as action item extraction, synchronization, reliability, and service operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information is required to provide the core functionality of extracting and managing action items and operating the service.
      </p>

      <h3>B. Automatically collected information</h3>
      <p>
        We collect minimal operational metadata, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>License key</li>
        <li>Request timestamps</li>
        <li>Request status (success or failure)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do NOT collect meeting note content in logs.
      </p>

      <h3>C. Website usage</h3>
      <p>
        Our website is a static landing page. We do not use analytics cookies, tracking pixels, or third-party advertising. We do not collect information about how you browse our website.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is used ONLY to provide the extension's functionality, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extracting action items from meeting notes</li>
        <li>Providing extension features</li>
        <li>Validating licenses</li>
        <li>Operating and maintaining the service</li>
        <li>Beta access requests (your email is used to contact you about Popouts access after the beta)</li>
        <li>Support (if you contact us, we may use the information you provide to respond)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Meeting note processing occurs only when explicitly initiated by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your data is NOT used for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Training AI models</li>
        <li>Advertising</li>
        <li>Analytics profiling</li>
        <li>Selling or monetizing data</li>
        <li>Research purposes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. AI Processing and Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
      <p>
        To provide functionality, Popouts sends meeting note text securely to AI processing providers, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenAI</li>
        <li>Anthropic (future fallback provider)</li>
        <li>Grok or similar providers (future fallback provider)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers process data solely to provide the requested functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is NOT used by Popouts to train AI models.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use the following third-party services to operate Popouts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Chrome Web Store:</strong> The extension is distributed through the Chrome Web Store. Google's privacy policy applies to the installation process: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Railway:</strong> Our backend services (LLM API, website) are hosted on Railway. Data sent to our API is processed on Railway's infrastructure. See <a href="https://railway.app/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railway's privacy policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Resend:</strong> We use Resend to send emails (e.g., beta access notifications). Your email address may be processed by Resend. See <a href="https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resend's privacy policy</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Meeting note content may be temporarily or persistently stored on Popouts servers as part of processing, reliability, debugging, and service operation. Storage occurs solely to provide the extension's functionality and is not used for advertising, profiling, or unrelated purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Meeting notes and related data are stored locally in your browser and are also securely transmitted to and stored on Popouts servers located in the United States to provide functionality such as action item extraction, data reliability, and service operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data retention period:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meeting notes and related data are stored for up to 1 year</li>
        <li>Users may request deletion at any time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Minimal operational logs are retained for service reliability and debugging. Operational logs are retained for up to 30 days unless required longer for security or legal obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local data stored in your browser (meeting names, agenda items, notes, action items) remains until you uninstall the extension or clear your browser data. We have no access to delete it remotely.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do NOT sell, rent, or trade your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only share data with third-party providers strictly necessary to provide the service, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI processing providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok)</li>
        <li>Infrastructure providers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers process data solely on our behalf. Third-party providers are contractually prohibited from using your data for advertising, profiling, or their own independent purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Revenue comes solely from subscription and license fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popouts stores and processes user data only as necessary to provide the extension's core functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement strong security measures to protect your data, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTPS encryption for all data transmission</li>
        <li>Encryption of data at rest</li>
        <li>Secure authentication and access controls</li>
        <li>Protection of API keys and credentials</li>
        <li>Restricted access to production systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No system can guarantee absolute security, but we take reasonable measures to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights and Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        You may request deletion of your data at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon deletion request, data will be permanently deleted from our systems and from third-party processing providers where applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To request deletion, contact:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="mailto:asankarrao@gmail.com">asankarrao@gmail.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will process deletion requests within a reasonable timeframe.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can delete all local data by uninstalling the Popouts extension. You can use Popouts without the automatic action extraction feature by adding action items manually instead.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Chrome Extension Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        Popouts uses only minimal Chrome permissions required for functionality, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>storage — to store extension settings locally</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Popouts does NOT access:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>Website content outside user input</li>
        <li>Personal Chrome account data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Popouts is reviewed and distributed through the Chrome Web Store and complies with Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Popouts is not intended for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have collected information from a child, please contact us and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
