# Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

For now, placeholder files are created. You can replace them with actual icons later.

To create icons:
1. Design a simple icon with "MN" or a meeting-related symbol
2. Export as PNG at the required sizes
3. Replace the placeholder files
